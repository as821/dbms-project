# dbms-project
DBMS Project for COSC280


TODO:
  * Finish writing mid-level functions in backend.py
  * Test DDL/DML parsing
  * Improve on basic query optimizer (see notes in optimizer.py.  Most important is to start using faster access paths)
  * Write driver program to provide a user interface w/ an infinite loop for input.  Call parser, query optimizer, backend for       DDL/DML
  * Improve backend efficiency (changes to low level access functions to make more efficient)
